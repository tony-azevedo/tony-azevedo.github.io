# Motor control in flies.

One avenue of our work is to describe the patterns of motor neuron activity that drive leg movements and behavior. Ultimately, we seek to understand how those patterns are controlled by neural circuits in the brain. We use calcium imaging and electrophysiology to caputure motor neuron activity with simultaneous behavior. Drosophila genetics provide tools to label individual motor neurons so that we can record from the same cell in different flies. For our first project, we put these approaches together to record activity in motor neurons that control flexion of the tibia. Tibia flexors comprise the largest population of motor neurons in the leg, called a motor pool. We found that, across the pool, tibia flexors exibit the same relationships between anatomical, physiological, and functional properties that have been found in vertebrate systems. This work revealed the functional organization of the fly leg motor system and established Drosophila as a tractable system for investigating neural mechanisms of limb motor control.
