This is not as silly as it may seem. Flies grip the surface they walk on with two appendages, 1) the claw on the tip of the tarsus and/or 2) the toothbrush of satae at the tip of the tarsus. The satae work a like gecko feet, using surface tension and electrostatic forces between the setae and the surface to adhere. Both appendage tips are controlled by the long tendon, which extend from the tip of the claw, across the tibia-tarsus joint, and continues across the femur-tibia joint. Two separate muscles control tension on the long tendon, innervated by eight (8!) motor neurons. Why so many neurons, why so many muscles for one tendon, and how do the muscles acutate both the satae and the claw? What is more, LTM motor neurons have a distinctive contralateral branch. What kind of input do LTM MNs receive from the contralateral neuromere?
