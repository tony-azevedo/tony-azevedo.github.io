This is not as silly as it may seem. Flies grip the surface they walk on with two appendages, 1) the claw on the tip of the tarsus and 2) a toothbrush-like array of "satae". The satae work like gecko feet, generating electrostatic forces to adhere to the surface. Both appendage tips are controlled by a single "long tendon", which extend from the tip of the claw, across the tibia-tarsus joint, and continues across the femur-tibia joint. Two separate muscles control tension on the long tendon, innervated by eight (8!) motor neurons. Why so many neurons, why so many muscles for one tendon, and how do the muscles acutate both the satae and the claw? Another mysterious detail, LTM motor neurons have a distinctive dendrite that extends to the contralateral leg circuits. What kind of input do LTM MNs receive on that contralateral dendrite, and why do they alone appear to care about what is happening in the other leg?
